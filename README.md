## How to make a PR (pull request)
 - from branch dev do: `git checkout -b "<branch name>"` (ex: `git checkout -b feat/implement-header-component`)
 - `git add "<your file path>"` or `git add .` to add all files changes
 - `git commit -m "<your message>"` (ex: `git commit -m"feat: implement header component"`)
 - `git push origin "<your branch>"` (ex: `git push origin feat/implement-header-component`)

### How to name your PR
 - add something new: `feat/your-new-feature`
 - fix something: `fix/bug-bla-bla`
