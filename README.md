# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to make a PR (pull request)
 - from branch dev do: `git checkout -b "<branch name>"` (ex: `git checkout -b feat/implement-header-component`)
 - `git add "<your file path>"` or `git add .` to add all files changes
 - `git commit -m "<your message>"` (ex: `git commit -m"feat: implement header component"`)
 - `git push origin "<your branch>"` (ex: `git push origin feat/implement-header-component`)

### How to name your PR
 - add something new: `feat/your-new-feature`
 - fix something: `fix/bug-bla-bla`
 - improve something: `improve/peformance-home-page`
 - refactor something: `refactor/home-page-component`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
